# CalderR AI Internship

**Project Location:** `Desktop/calderr-ai-2026`  
**Author:** Sohaib Akhlaq  
**Status:** Week 4 In Progress

## Overview

This repository documents the complete setup, learning progress, and hands-on implementation completed during the CalderR AI internship. It covers environment configuration, foundational AI concepts, agentic systems, LangChain workflows, prompt-engineering experiments, structured outputs, tool calling, external API integration, and fully deployed production AI applications.

---

## Project Goals

- Work with large language models via APIs
- Understand agentic AI design patterns
- Build simple LLM-based applications in Python
- Explore prompt engineering and persona-driven prompting
- Create reusable, readable project documentation
- Integrate all concepts into production-ready deployments

---

## Quick Start — One Command

```powershell
# Activate the environment
cd C:\Users\USER\Desktop\calderr-ai-2026
.\calderr-env\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# All Week 1 and Week 2 scripts now work inside calderr-env.
# streamlit, plotly, httpx, langchain, pydantic — all installed.
```

After activation, run any project with a single command:

```powershell
# Week 1: Professional Chatbot
python week1/professional_chatbot.py

# Week 2: API Aggregator Agent (CLI)
python week2/project2_i_c_api_aggregator.py

# Week 2: Financial Data Analysis Agent (Streamlit)
# Use calderr-env python explicitly — streamlit is installed there
calderr-env\Scripts\python.exe -m streamlit run week2/project2_p_c_financial_analysis.py
```
